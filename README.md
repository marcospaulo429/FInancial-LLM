# Sentiment Analysis of Brazilian Stock Market Tweets

## Overview
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model for tweets related to the Brazilian stock market. The model is being developed as part of a master's research project to assist in identifying sentiment trends in the Brazilian financial market.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to preprocess the raw tweet data from the Brazilian stock market to prepare it for sentiment analysis. This preprocessing step involves cleaning, tokenization, normalization, and other text processing techniques to extract relevant features from the tweet data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets collected from various sources related to the Brazilian stock market. These tweets are labeled with sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral) to facilitate sentiment analysis.

## Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing pipeline includes the following steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise, such as URLs, special characters, and punctuation.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Normalization**: Converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatizing words.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the text, such as word frequencies or TF-IDF scores.
